# Ambient Noise Generator ??

An interactive ambient noise generator that mixes and plays multiple sound samples in real-time. This web-based tool features customizable sliders for controlling the volume of each sample, dynamically changing playback patterns, and automatic variation switching for endless ambient soundscapes.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Mixing**: Control multiple different sound samples, each with its own volume slider.
- **Randomized Playback**: Each sound sample multiple variations that are randomly swapped upon playback completion.
- **Smooth Transitions**: Sliders animate over random time intervals, creating a dynamic ambient experience.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simply press "Start" to initialize the audio and adjust the sliders for a personalized soundscape.

Built using pure JavaScript and the Web Audio API, this project provides an engaging way to explore ambient soundscapes and generative audio.
